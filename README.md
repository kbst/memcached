# [Memcached Operator for Kubernetes](https://www.kubestack.com/catalog/memcached)

The Memcached operator provides a managed service like experience for Memcache in-memory
caches on any Kubernetes cluster. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small
chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls,
or page rendering.

This repository holds the source and is the right place if you want to contribute to the operator.
If you want to try the operator please head over to the [Memcached operator](https://www.kubestack.com/catalog/memcached)
