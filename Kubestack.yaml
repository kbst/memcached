# Descriptive text.
description: |-
  The Kubestack Memcached operator provides a managed service like experience
  running a Memcached cluster on Kubernetes.
  Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data
  (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page
  rendering.
  The operator takes care of provisioning and deprovisioning as well
  as keeping clusters running and upgrading existing clusters.
  The operator can manage one or more Memcached clusters across different
  Kubernetes namespaces.

            This headless service will return one IP per replica.
            Make sure your memcached driver is configured to do consistent
            hashing and refreshes the list of backends from DNS. The IPs
            will change when you scale replicas or pods are replaced.
