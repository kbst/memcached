  Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data
  (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page
  rendering.

            This headless service will return one IP per replica.
            Make sure your memcached driver is configured to do consistent
            hashing and refreshes the list of backends from DNS. The IPs
            will change when you scale replicas or pods are replaced.
